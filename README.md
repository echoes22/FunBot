# FunBot

FunBot is a simple discord bot made using the Discord API and hosted on Replit. 

Its purpose is to mess with your friends, by selecting a target and moving everyone in the voice channel when the target joins.

There are two ways of selecting the target. The first is by typing '$choose' in any channel on the server, followed by tagging the intended target. ($choose @TARGET)
The other one is by typing '$random' in any channel, which selects a random target from the voice channel in which the user who typed the message is connected.
